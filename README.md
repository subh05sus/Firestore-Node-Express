# Firebase Firestore with Node.js and Express

This repository contains sample code and instructions on how to integrate Firebase Firestore with a Node.js and Express application to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm: [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- Firebase account: [Create one here](https://firebase.google.com/)
- Postman: [Download here](https://www.postman.com/)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up Firebase:
   - Create a Firebase project and set up Firestore.
   - Obtain your Firebase project credentials (service account key) in JSON format.

4. Configure Firebase:
   - Rename the `firebaseConfig.example.js` file to `firebaseConfig.js`.
   - Replace the placeholder values in `firebaseConfig.js` with your Firebase project credentials.

5. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. Use Postman to test the CRUD operations by sending HTTP requests to the specified endpoints.

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/data`: Retrieve all data from Firestore.
- `GET /api/data/:id`: Retrieve data by ID.
- `POST /api/data`: Create new data.
- `PUT /api/data/:id`: Update data by ID.
- `DELETE /api/data/:id`: Delete data by ID.

## Example Usage

### Creating New Data (POST)

```json
POST /api/data
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "johndoe@example.com"
}
```

### Retrieving Data (GET)

- Retrieve all data:

  ```
  GET /api/data
  ```

- Retrieve data by ID:

  ```
  GET /api/data/:id
  ```

### Updating Data (PUT)

```json
PUT /api/data/:id
{
  "name": "Updated Name",
  "email": "updated@example.com"
}
```

### Deleting Data (DELETE)

```
